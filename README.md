# Vue/Lumin Framework

This project involves creating a basic Vue.js application with a single HTML file and a Vue instance. The Vue instance is utilized to fetch data from a Lumen API, which the developer must create and populate with their own data. The fetched data is then displayed as a sorted listing of entries on the webpage.

Additionally, the project requires implementing a feature that allows users to click on an entry to view the details of that specific entry. This involves connecting to a separate API to retrieve the details, which are then displayed on the webpage without navigating to a different page.

To enhance user experience, the project also includes proper error handling for failed API requests and displays loading indicators as needed. Furthermore, the webpage must be responsive, ensuring it is usable and visually appealing across a range of devices from mobile to desktop.
